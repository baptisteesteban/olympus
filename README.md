## Description

The Olympus Image Processing Library is an experimental library implemented in
Rust. My initial objective when starting to build this library was to learn the
Rust programming language by working on a project that would be useful for my
personal experiments. Its design is **strongly** inspired by the
[Pylene](https://gitlab.lre.epita.fr/olena/pylene) image processing library and
follows the same aims. **It has to be noted that this library is entirely developed during my free time, and its progress may be affected by my various other activities.**

Currently, Olympus is not available on the [Rust community's crate
registry](https://crates.io) but it is intended to when it will be mature
enough.

In the case you have some ideas or advices about the library, fell free to fill
an [issue](https://github.com/baptisteesteban/olympus/issues).
